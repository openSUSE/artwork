GNOME Default Wallpaper
=======================

dynamic/
 [built from dynamic-wallpaper.xml.in and svg files]

 This is the dynamic wallpaper as understood by gnome-desktop. The dynamic
 wallpaper is a slideshow described by the XML file in dynamic, and is based on
 the different svg files.


openSUSE-default-static.xml:
 [built from openSUSE-default-static.xml.in]

 This is a XML file as understood by gnome-desktop, that describes a slideshow.
 There is only one slide, the default wallpaper, available in various
 resolutions.


wallpaper-branding-openSUSE.xml:
dynamic-wallpaper-branding-openSUSE.xml:
 [built from wallpaper-branding-openSUSE.xml.in]

 This is a XML file as understood by gnome-control-center. It describes a
 specific wallpaper that gnome-control-center can set as wallpaper
 (openSUSE-default-static.xml).


Testing the dynamic wallpaper
=============================

From the top directory for the artwork (the one above ./gnome/), build the
requires files with "make gnome_dynamic", and then change your current
wallpaper:

  # Get your current background:
  OLD_BACKGROUND=`gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri`
  # Set the background to the dynamic wallpaper
  gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file://`pwd`/gnome/dynamic-wallpaper-localtest.xml
  # Restore your previous background
  gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri "${OLD_BACKGROUND}"

Since by default, the dynamic wallpaper is slow to change, you can use the fast
test version, where 20 minutes are accelerated to 1 second (a whole cycle takes
72 seconds):

  gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file://`pwd`/gnome/dynamic-wallpaper-localtest-fast.xml

Note that it only works if your git checkout is not located in a directory
containing characters that should be escaped for URI (like a space).
